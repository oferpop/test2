# My Python Project

## Project Description

This Python project includes several modules for performing arithmetic operations and other functionalities. It's structured to enforce certain programming rules, like calling a function from one module before another.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:


## Modules

- `simp.py`: Contains basic arithmetic functions (add and subtract).
- `comp.py`: Contains more complex functions (sum of digits and palindrome check) with a dependency on `simp.py`.
- `col.py`: Contains a custom implementation of the zip function.
